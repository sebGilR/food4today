# Food 4 Today

This is a React web application where you can navigate through different food categories and get the recipe for any of them, along with a video tutorial, ingredients, and instructions. Each recipe is loaded with a URL displaying the recipe ID.

Based on the [Catalogue of Dog Clothes](https://www.notion.so/Catalogue-of-Dog-Clothes-8bf1512b8ab34fa28848beb8ab698a32) project specifications.
